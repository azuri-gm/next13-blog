Perhaps one of the reasons for this is the extensive ecosystem of extensions that currently exist. And while some IDEs may have the functionality that these extensions provide, the customization potential alone make it a very attractive offering for all the text editor user's.\n\nIn this brief guide, we'll go over the top 5 extensions I believe all web developers can benefit from. I'll go over what they do and how they can make your coding journey all the merrier. Let's jump right in!\n\n- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)\n- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)\n- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)\n- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)\n- [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode 'Quokka JS marketplace')\n\n## Prettier\n\nIf you haven't heard about it [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that supports most commonly used programming languages; This allows teams to standarize code styles and save time/energy for the developers.\n\nThis extension will help you get used to setting it up and enable you things like automatically fixing formatting issues in your code, fixing the mix of single and double-quotes or an irregular use of semicolons.\n\n> Some of the supported technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, JSON, CSS, HTML, Vue, Angular, Markdown, YAML, and more.\n\n## GitLens\n\nThis extension combines the capabilities of Git and empowers them within the text editor, It allows you to learn who, why, and even when code was changed within the repository.
