# Uses

This is a list of the equipment I use as part of my day-to-day work as a software engineer.

## Computer & Hardware

- [Macbook Pro 16](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch): So far it has been a breeze working on this machine, can deal with pretty much everything you throw at it.
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Apple Magic Trackpad

## Development Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): My editor of choice, it's a very lightweight but pretty extensible piece of software. One of the selling points for me is how customizable it is (if you want to see my settings you can find them [here](https://gist.github.com/azuri-gm/246bca4680c893bdee27ce948f686783)).
- [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): Using [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) to help you code everyday, what more can I say?.
- Git
- Postman

## Productivity Tools

- Notion
- Jira
